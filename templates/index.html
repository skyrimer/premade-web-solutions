            <h3>Hello <span class="wavy-hand">üëã</span></h3>
            <p>Want to start to make websites and flex in front of your classmates that you are a <span
                    class="color-favourite">üë®‚ÄçüíªTech Geniusüë®‚Äçüíª</span> ? This website is for you!</p>
            <p>I started to program without any support or guidelines. Looking back, I do understand that
                searching for valid
                information was not the issue. The main issues were to understand what does the code do and
                correctly use it in the
                projects. This problem leads to a lack of clarity, and confusion when an error raises.</p>
            <p>Using this website, I will try to help newbies creating websites with Html<img
                    src="/static/images/my_icons/html.svg" alt="Html" class="inline" loading="lazy">/Css<img
                    src="/static/images/my_icons/css.svg" alt="Css" class="inline" loading="lazy">/Javascript<img
                    src="/static/images/my_icons/javascript.svg" alt="Html" class="inline" loading="lazy">
                by providing crystal clear explanation in simple language of how most common components are
                constructed.

            <h3>It's easy to find all the information</h3>
            <p>Finding all the information all around the internet might be complicated to start with and
                takes quite a lot of time‚åö. This website can provide you with the base knowledge to narrow
                down the query searches, which will dramatically shorten the time spend on googling‚åõ.</p>
            <p>Another thing is like the website is like a bouquetüíê that unite all the flowers. As soon as
                you get used to the navigation it would be easy to go back and remind yourself of almost
                everything you need.</p>
            <p>Finally, the website will provide you with explanations in digestible language. Ideally, you
                can show this to your grandmaüëµ, and even she will understand how to make a slider!</p>

            <p>Developers always baulk into time management issues. This is why saving minutes and nerves
                are important to take into account. The greatest way to approach the problem, in my opinion,
                is to use online resources.</p>
            <p>They are easy to access, not complicated to use, but almost impossible to find. That's why I
                want to share my finding with you!</p>
