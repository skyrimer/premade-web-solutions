    <h2>A way to make smooth scrolling</h2>
    <article class="text">
        <p>You might have spotted that on some websites scrolling feels weird. It seems to have some sort of
            inertia. For instance <a target="_blank" href="https://www.niarratravel.com" class="inline-link">this
                website</a></p>
        <p>This technique is called üöÇlocomotive scrollingüöÇ because it smoothly starts and smooth finishes
            to scroll as if you are on the Swiss train. It does not drastically affect the user experience
            but improves it. The simplest way to realise this effect is to use <a target="_blank"
                href="https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/" class="inline-link">Locomotive-Scroll</a>
            JavaScript Library. It is easy to set up, and it
            has a bunch of features to satisfy all your needs
            including parallax.</p>
        <p>To start with, you need to connect both JavaScript (for animations) and Css (for custom
            scrollbar). You can use both <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/locomotive-scroll"
                class="inline-link">npm</a> or <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/locomotive-scroll"
                class="inline-link">cloud
                package</a></p>
        <pre><code class="html">
npm install locomotive-scroll

&lt;!-- or --&gt;

&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/locomotive-scroll@4.1.3/dist/locomotive-scroll.min.css"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/locomotive-scroll@4.1.3/dist/locomotive-scroll.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                                    </code></pre>
        <p>After you have connected all necessary stuff, you have to activate locomotive scrolling using JS:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="js">
const scroll = new LocomotiveScroll({
  el: document.querySelector("[data-scroll-container]"),
  smooth: true,
});
                                            </code></pre>
        <p>In your HTML you have to add at least 1 <code class="html">data-scroll-container</code> attribute
            to any element.</p>
        <pre><code class="html">
&lt;div class="continer" data-scroll-container&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                                </code></pre>
        <p>That's itüëç! Refresh your document, and you will see the magic of a better scrolling experience.
            The values set by default work perfectly and look good for the majority of cases. However, if
            you want to customise something, You just need to pass some new parameters to the dictionary of
            arguments. There are many of them, but I will list the most useful in my opinion.</p>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>
                <p><code class="html">direction</code> - specifies the direction of the effect. Can be <code
                        class="html">vertical</code> and <code class="html">horizontal</code>. It is useful
                    in case you want to make animated elements moving horizontally.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code class="html">lerp</code> - smoothness of the scrolling. Take values from <code
                        class="html">0</code> to <code class="html">1</code>, where <code class="html">1</code>
                    is
                    no effect and <code class="html">0</code> is no scrolling
                    at all. Just a values to play around.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code class="html">multiplier</code> - factor applied to the scrolling. The higher the
                    value, the more page scrolls.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code class="html">firefoxMultiplier</code> - factor applied to the scrolling for FireFox
                    browser.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code class="html">touchMultiplier</code> - factor applied to the scrolling on
                    touchscreen devices. Generally, you want this to be higher than the default value,
                    because on phones you have to scroll way more than on any big screen.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Adding <code class="html">data-scroll-section</code> to the elements inside <code
                        class="html">data-scroll-container</code> might improve performance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>General note. If you have some JavaScript code that changes the hight of the content (for
                    instance: syntax highlighting that adds paddings), you need to run this piece of code
                    first, and then initialise locomotive scroll.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>There is only 1 issue with implementing this feature: you can not scroll using middle button,
                    and there is nothing to do with itüò•. On one hand, it is actually good, because the users
                    won't scroll through without even noticing the content. On the other hand, people who are
                    used to the middle button will suffer a bit from it.</p>
            </li>
