    <h2>Page transition</h2>
    <article class="text">
        <p>One of my favourite effects on websites is page transition. It makes the process of going from one
            webpage to another smoothüçÉ by adding fancy animation. For instance, this website also contains fading page
            transition!. If you click on any link, all the content will fade out, and the new one will fade in when it
            is ready, while the navigation stays the same.</p>
        <p>There are several ways to achieve this affect: with native JavaScript, <a href="https://barba.js.org"
                class="inline-link">Barba Js</a>, <a href="https://highway.js.org" class="inline-link">Highway Js</a>,
            but we are going to use <a href="https://swup.js.org" class="inline-link">Swup Library</a> because of its
            simplicity</p>
        <p>Firstly, you need to have the same markdown for all the pages that you want to add the animation. It should
            have a container with an <code class="html">id="swup"</code> and <code
                class="html">class=""transition-fade</code>. The id defines the content that is going to be
            reloaded (the content inside will undergo the animation) and the class will be used in CSS to animate
            everything.</p>
        <pre><code class="html">
&lt;main id="swup" class="transition-fade"&gt;
  &lt;!-- Your contenet here that is going to be refreshed --&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;
&lt;script src="/path-to-file/swup.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p>In terms of JavaScript, everything you need to do, is to activate the library with just one line</p>
        <pre><code class="js">
const swup = new Swup();
        </code></pre>
        <p>Finaly, you have to add your styling for animation using css. <code class="css">.transition-fade</code> will
            be added to your content, when the content will be reloaded. In our case, we need to add <code
                class="css">opacity</code> for fading effect and <code class="css">transition</code> to make transition
            smooth</p>
        <pre><code class="css">
.transition-fade {
  transition: 0.4s;
  opacity: 1;
}

html.is-animating .transition-fade {
  opacity: 0;
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>And that's it! You have introduced a fancy page transitionüòé.</p>
        <p>However, I have to note that you will also need a few features. The main issue of library is that it does not
            manually reload CSS and JavaScript, which means that you have to do it yourself. For this purpose, there are
            2 custom event listeners: <code class="html">contentReplaced</code> that is going to be activated after the
            content was replaced with new information, and <code class="html">willReplaceContent</code> that is called
            right before the content is reloaded</p>
        <p>In order not to repeat the information from the official documentation, I will leave the <a
                href="https://swup.js.org/getting-started/reloading-javascript" target="_blank" class="inline-link">link
                to it</a>. It clearly and fairly simple explains everything.</p>
