    <article class="text">
        <p>In certain cases, just displaying the image for information is not enough. One of the ways to add some
            style and interactivity is to add the tilt effect that user can play around with. There is no real UX
            reason for that, but it might be used for some UI reasons. Here is the example.</p>
        <p>There are 2 ways to achieve similar effect:</p>

    <h3>Pure CSS reverse tilt</h3>
    <p>Before we start, I need to explain the process. The way tilting animation is realised in pure CSS is that we
        have an element with content. On top of this content (and before in terms of HTML), we put an invisible grid of
        cells or tiles. This grid has
        an equal number of rows and columns: 1x1, 5x5, 20x20 and so on (there is a way to make a different number of
        rows and columns, but it would make CSS files even bigger). When the user hovers on the cells, the content is
        tilted. So, here comes the first problem: you need to create and maintain the number of cells throughout the
        projects.</p>
    <p>Example of the HTML structure can look like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="html">
&lt;div class="tilt-container small"&gt;
  &lt;span class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
  class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
  class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
  class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
  class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
  class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
  class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
  class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="tilt-rotation-cell"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="tilt-content"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Pure CSS 4x4 cells&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://source.unsplash.com/700x700/?tiger" alt="tiger"&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>Hint: you can easily create the exact amount of cells using <a href="https://emmet.io" class="inline-link"
            target="_blank">Emmet</a> extension. For instance, if I want to create a 20x20 grid, then I can do it like
        this: <code class="html">span.tilt-rotation-cell*400</code></p>
    <p>And here comes the most illogical and fun part (noðŸ˜”). In CSS, there are a few things that you need to track
        outside regular styling. Your preserve container that wraps both grid and content needs to have <code
            class="css">perspective: relative</code> and
        <code class="css">transform-style: preserve-3d</code>. It means that the same container must also have <code
            class="css">overflow: visible</code>, <code class="css">filter: none</code>, and <code
            class="css">backdrop-filter: none</code>. Otherwise, the tilt effect is not going to work as it is supposed
        to be. It should look like this.
    <pre><code class="scss">
.tilt-container {
  $speed: 100ms;
  $easing: ease;
  $perspective: 1000px;
  position: relative;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  perspective: $perspective;
  .tilt-content {
    transition: transform $speed $easing;
    img {
      max-width: 100%;
      max-height: 100%;
      border-radius: 30px;
    }
  }
}
        </code></pre>
    <p>Finally, here comes the ðŸ”®magicðŸ”®. Depending on the grid size, tiles need to have different positions,
        dimensions, X-rotation indexes and Y-rotation indexes. It can be calculated by hand, but it will take time and
        cause difficulties for upscaling. I have solved it by creating a Sass mixin that does it automatically. I will
        not explain the maths behind the mixin, because my English skills are not that proficient. It can take five
        parameters: cells number (number of cells in a row), rotation angle (absolute value of maximum rotation angle),
        axis lock ("x" will lock the x-axis; "y" will lock the y-axis; any other value will not lock anything), cell
        class name and content class name. It will help with upscaling and calculating.</p>
    <p>Here is the mixin, and application example:</p>
    <pre><code class="scss">
@mixin tiltAnimation(
  $cells-number: 10,
  $rotation-angle: 20,
  $lockAxis: "none",
  $cell-class-name: "tilt-rotation-cell",
  $content-class-name: "tilt-content"
) {
  $percentageOfHundred: calc(100% / $cells-number);
  $rotation-gradient: (2 * $rotation-angle) / ($cells-number - 1);
  $rotation-intersect: $rotation-angle + $rotation-gradient;
  
  .#{$cell-class-name} {
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 5;
    width: $percentageOfHundred;
    height: $percentageOfHundred;
  }
  @for $row from 1 to $cells-number + 1 {
    @for $column from 1 to $cells-number + 1 {
      .#{$cell-class-name}:nth-child(#{( ($row * $cells-number) + $column - $cells-number)}) {
        top: ($row * $percentageOfHundred) - $percentageOfHundred;
        left: ($column * $percentageOfHundred) - $percentageOfHundred;
      }
      .#{$cell-class-name}:nth-child(#{(($row *$cells-number) + $column - $cells-number)}):hover
      ~ .#{$content-class-name} {
        @if $lockAxis == "y" {
          transform: rotateY(
            (($column * $rotation-gradient) - $rotation-intersect) * 1deg
        );
        } @else if $lockAxis == "x" {
          transform: rotateX(((-$row * $rotation-gradient) + $rotation-intersect) * 1deg);
        } @else {
          transform: rotateX(((-$row * $rotation-gradient) + $rotation-intersect) * 1deg)
            rotateY((($column * $rotation-gradient) - $rotation-intersect) * 1deg);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
.tilt-container {
  &.big {
    @include tiltAnimation(20, 15, false, "tilt-rotation-cell", "tilt-content");
  }
  &.small {
    @include tiltAnimation(4, 20, false, "tilt-rotation-cell", "tilt-content");
  }
}
        </code></pre>
    <p>And it finally works! This solution is perfect for small personal projects or tiny objects on the webpage, but I
        would not recommend using it for other cases because:</p>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>
            <p>Adds a lot of HTML because cells take some space</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Low Html to text ratio will lower SEO score</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Adds a lot of CSS because each cell has its rotation index</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>No reverse effect (when the image tends toward the cursor instead of distancing from it)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The animation might look chunky if there are too few cells</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Hard to customise the effect (glare effect, event listeners, keep the tilt after the mouse leaves
                the element, etc)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Doesn't work on mobile devices</p>
        </li>

    <h3>Using Vanilla Tilt library</h3>
    <p>As it is stated in the heading, this solution will require the Vanilla Tilt library, but it also allows to create
        any tilt effect within seconds! Everything you need to do is to connect to the library. Afterwards, there are
        two ways to activate tilt effect: data attributes and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>If you are connecting with JavaScript, you just need to run init method of VanillaTilt object. The first
        parameter is the list of elements, that need to be animated. The second parameter is a dictionary with values
        that allows to customise tilt effect. Below, you can see an example of activision with a dictionary of all value
        with their defaults.</p>
    <pre><code class="js">
VanillaTilt.init(document.querySelectorAll("[data-my-tilt]"), {
  reverse: false, // reverse the tilt direction
  max: 35, // max tilt rotation (degrees)
  startX: 0, // the starting tilt on the X axis, in degrees.
  startY: 0, // the starting tilt on the Y axis, in degrees.
  perspective: 1000, // Transform perspective, the lower the more extreme the tilt gets.
  scale: 1, // 2 = 200%, 1.5 = 150%, etc..
  speed: 300, // Speed of the enter/exit transition
  transition: true, // Set a transition on enter/exit.
  axis: null, // What axis should be disabled. Can be X or Y.
  reset: true, // If the tilt effect has to be reset on exit.
  easing: "cubic-bezier(.03,.98,.52,.99)", // Easing on enter/exit.
  glare: false, // if it should have a "glare" effect
  "max-glare": 1, // the maximum "glare" opacity (1 = 100%, 0.5 = 50%)
  "glare-prerender": false, // false = VanillaTilt creates the glare elements for you, otherwise
    // you need to add .js-tilt-glare>.js-tilt-glare-inner by yourself
  "mouse-event-element": null, // css-selector or link to HTML-element what will be listen mouse events
  gyroscope: true, // Boolean to enable/disable device orientation detection,
  gyroscopeMinAngleX: -45, // This is the bottom limit of the device angle on X axis, meaning that a device rotated at
    // this angle would tilt the element as if the mouse was on the left border of the element;
  gyroscopeMaxAngleX: 45, // This is the top limit of the device angle on X axis, meaning that a device rotated at this
    // angle would tilt the element as if the mouse was on the right border of the element;
  gyroscopeMinAngleY: -45, // This is the bottom limit of the device angle on Y axis, meaning that a device rotated at
    // this angle would tilt the element as if the mouse was on the top border of the element;
  gyroscopeMaxAngleY: 45, // This is the top limit of the device angle on Y axis, meaning that a device rotated at this
    // angle would tilt the element as if the mouse was on the bottom border of the element;
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>But you can get the exact same result without writing a single line of JavaScript. Just set <code
            class="html">data-tilt</code> to an element, and it will also work. To change its parameter, just add the
        corresponding data attribute like <code class="html">data-tilt-full-page-listening</code>.</p>
    <p>That's it! Now you are the tilting master. Check out the example.</p>
